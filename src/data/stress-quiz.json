  "description": "Stress is a natural part of life, but when it becomes overwhelming, it can affect our emotions, productivity, and overall well-being. This questionnaire is designed to help you evaluate your current stress levels by reflecting on your thoughts, feelings, and daily experiences. There are no right or wrong answersâ€”just be honest about how you've been feeling. Each question has four options, ranging from 'Almost' to 'Usually,' to help measure the frequency of your stress-related experiences. By understanding your stress levels, you can take steps to manage them better and improve your overall well-being. Take a deep breath, and let's begin.",
