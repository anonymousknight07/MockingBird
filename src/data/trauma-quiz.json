  "title": "Trauma Impact Assessment",
  "description": "Trauma can affect our thoughts, emotions, and daily life in ways we may not always realize. This questionnaire is designed to help you reflect on your experiences and assess how past events might be impacting you. There are no right or wrong answers—just respond honestly based on how you've been feeling. Each question has five options, ranging from 'Not at all' to 'Extremely', to help measure the intensity of your experiences. Your responses can provide insights into patterns of distress and help you understand your emotional well-being better. Take your time, and remember—you are not alone in this journey.",
